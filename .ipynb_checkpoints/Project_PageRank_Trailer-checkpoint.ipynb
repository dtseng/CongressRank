    "> PageRank is an algorithm used by Google Search to rank websites in their search engine results. PageRank was named after Larry Page, one of the founders of Google. PageRank is a way of measuring the importance of website pages. According to Google:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>PageRank works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is. The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four common frameworks by which academics view Google's PageRank algorithm. The first looks at the social impact, both positive and negative, of immediate access to previously unimaginable knowledge through one centralized terminal. The second, and most mathematical, sees PageRank as a computation of the Singular Value Decomposition (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition\">SVD</a>) of the adjacency matrix of the graph formed by the internet, with particular emphasis paid to the first few singular vectors. The third, and most far-reaching, practical technical implication of Google's work is the implementation of algorithms and computation at enormous scale. Much of the computing infrastructure which operates at a global scale deployed today can trace its origins to Google's need to perform SVD on an object as enormous as the Internet. Finally, a more intuitive way to look at the PageRank algorithm is through the lens of a web crawler (or many web crawler) acting as an agent (or agents) in a Markov Chain the size of the web. We will investigate this viewpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "This crawler is searching for an approximate \"invariant\" distribution (why does a true invariant distribution almost certainly not exist?) and will rank pages based on their \"probability\" in this generated distribution. In order to do so, our crawler chooses to follow a link uniformly at random from the page it is on in order to arrive at a new page, keeping tally of how many times it has visited each page. If this crawler runs for a really, really long time, the fraction of time it has spent on each webpage will approximately be the probability of being on that page (assuming we account for pathologies in the Markov chain which we will discuss soon). We then rank pages in decreasing order of probability."
